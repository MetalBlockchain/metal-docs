| [**Issuing API Calls**](issuing-api-calls.md)      | This guide explains how to make calls to APIs exposed by Metal nodes.                                                                           |
| The [**Platform Chain (P-Chain) API**](p-chain.md) | Allows clients to interact with the P-Chain (Platform Chain), which maintains Metal’s validator set and handles blockchain and Subnet creation. |
| The [**Contract Chain (C-Chain) API**](c-chain.md) | Allows clients to interact with the C-Chain, Metal’s main EVM instance, as well as other EVM instances.                                         |
| The [**Exchange Chain (X-Chain) API**](x-chain.md) | Allows clients to create and trade assets, including METAL, on the X-Chain as well as other instances of the AVM.                                    |
| The [**Admin API**](admin.md)                      | Allows clients to examine a node’s internal state, set of connections, and similar internal protocol data.                                          |
| The [**Auth API**](auth.md)                        | Allows clients to manage the creation and revocation of authorization tokens.                                                                       |
| The [**Health API**](health.md)                    | Allows clients to check a node’s health.                                                                                                            |
| The [**Index API**](index-api.md)                  | Fetch transactions, vertex, or block by ID.                                                                                                         |
| The [**Info API**](info.md)                        | Allows clients to examine basic information about a node.                                                                                           |
| The [**Keystore API**](keystore.md)                | Allows customers to use the embedded Keystore file of an Metal node.                                                                            |
| The [**Metrics API**](metrics.md)                  | Allows clients to get statistics about a node’s health and performance.                                                                             |
