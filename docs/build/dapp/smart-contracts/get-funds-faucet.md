# Get Test Funds from the Fuji Testnet Faucet

The [Fuji Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network) sends METAL to X-Chain or C-Chain
addresses to help you test. (This testnet METAL has no value.)

We can get a "drip" of METAL from the Fuji faucet. Paste the address into the
[Fuji faucet website](https://faucet.avax.network). These METAL are for the Fuji
Testnet and have no monetary value.

 If you already have an METAL balance greater than zero on Mainnet, 
paste your C-Chain address there, and request test tokens.
The faucet will send some METAL to the address and return a transaction ID
(txID). 
This txID can be used with the Fuji Testnet Explorer to learn more about
the transaction.

Otherwise, 
please request a faucet coupon on 
[Guild](https://guild.xyz/avalanche). Admins and mods on the official [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RwXY7P6)
can provide testnet METAL if developers are unable to obtain it from the other two options.
