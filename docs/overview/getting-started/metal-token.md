# Metal Token

Metal is the native token of the Metal blockchain. It’s hard-capped to 666,666,666 units and used to pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple Subnets created on Metal.

## Staking

The minimum amount of METAL required to stake to become a validator is 2,000 METAL. If you don’t own a validator node, but do want to stake your tokens, you can do so by delegating your stake to an available node.
Users can stake their tokens for a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks.

## Tokenomics

METAL has a hard-capped supply of 666,666,666 coins. The genesis block will have 333,333,333 METAL coins in circulation at launch, of which a maximum of 133,177,776 METAL can be generated from MTL genesis, 71,000,000 METAL granted to founders (vested over 12 months) and 144,333,333 METAL granted to the foundation. 

Similar to Avalanche and Proton, resources spent by a validator for staking are proportional to the validator’s total stake. Rewards accumulated by validators are proportional to their total stake. Fees are burned, decreasing supply over time. Validators locking their stake for longer periods of time are rewarded proportionately, additionally, validators are incentivized to stay online and operate correctly through proof-of-uptime and proof-of-correctness, pioneered in Avalanche.

## Fee structure

Fees are not returned to validators, rather they are burned, adding a deflationary dynamic to METAL. Stakers are incentivized by the emission structure of METAL which is set to release 333,333,333 METAL on a sliding scale which becomes increasingly scarce over a long period of time.
